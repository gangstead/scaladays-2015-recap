scaladays-2015-recap
=====================

My best guess at the important parts of 

Presentation for Dallas Scala Enthusiasts [Meetup on 4/9/2015](http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Scala-Enthusiasts/events/220565633/)

# The Slides
### TL;DR [Slides here](https://gangstead.github.io/scaladays-2015-recap)

Since the default branch is gh-pages, go to http://gangstead.github.io/scaladays-2015-recap to view the slides.

To view the slides locally start a [static http server](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) from that directory.  My preferred way:

```
# one time, to install the dependency
> npm install -g http-server

# start the server in the base directory. -o flag opens browser
> http-server -o
```
